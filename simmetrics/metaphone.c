 * Metaphone Algorithm
 *
 * I found this code online at the following location:
 * http://aspell.net/metaphone/metaphone-kuhn.txt
 * and integrated the algorithm into simmetrics with a few minor modifications,
 * if some licensing dispute arises I will rewrite the algorithm myself but since
 * Aspell uses the same license as
 * simmetrics I don't forsee a problem...
 *
 * Created by Lawrence Philips (location unknown). Metaphone presented
 * in article in "Computer Language" December 1990 issue.
 *
 * Converted from Pick BASIC, as demonstrated in article, to C by
 * Michael J. Kuhn (Baltimore, Maryland)
 *
 * My original intention was to replace SOUNDEX with METAPHONE in
 * order to get lists of similar sounding names that were more precise.
 * SOUNDEX maps "William" and "Williams" to the same values. METAPHONE
 * as it turns out DOES THE SAME.  There are going to be problems
 * that you need to resolve with your own set of data.
 *
 * Basically, for my problem with S's I think that if
 *
 * IF metaphone[strlen(metaphone)] == "S"
 * AND strlen(metaphone) >= 4  THEN
 *
 * metaphone[strlen(metaphone)] = ""
 *
 * You can add you own rules as required.
 *
 * Also, Lawrence Philips suggests that for practical reasons only the
 * first 4 characters of the metaphone be used. This happens to be the
 * number of characters that Soundex produces. This is indeed practical
 * if you already have reserved exactly 4 characters in your database.
 *
 * In addition an analysis of your data may show that names are split
 * into undesirable "metaphone groups" as the number of metaphone characters
 * increases.
 *
 * *********** BEGIN METAPHONE RULES ***********
 *
 * Lawrence Philips' RULES follow:
 *
 * The 16 consonant sounds:
 * |--- ZERO represents "th"
 * |
 * B  X  S  K  J  T  F  H  L  M  N  P  R  0  W  Y
 *
 * Exceptions:
 *
 * Beginning of word: "ae-", "gn", "kn-", "pn-", "wr-"  ----> drop first letter
 * "Aebersold", "Gnagy", "Knuth", "Pniewski", "Wright"
 *
 * Beginning of word: "x"                                ----> change to "s"
 * as in "Deng Xiaopeng"
 *
 * Beginning of word: "wh-"                              ----> change to "w"
 * as in "Whalen"
 *
 * Transformations:
 *
 * B ----> B      unless at the end of word after "m", as in "dumb", "McComb"
 *
 * C ----> X      (sh) if "-cia-" or "-ch-"
 * S      if "-ci-", "-ce-", or "-cy-"
 * SILENT if "-sci-", "-sce-", or "-scy-"
 * K      otherwise, including in "-sch-"
 *
 * D ----> J      if in "-dge-", "-dgy-", or "-dgi-"
 * T      otherwise
 *
 * F ----> F
 *
 * G ---->        SILENT if in "-gh-" and not at end or before a vowel
 * in "-gn" or "-gned"
 * in "-dge-" etc., as in above rule
 * J      if before "i", or "e", or "y" if not double "gg"
 * K      otherwise
 *
 * H ---->        SILENT if after vowel and no vowel follows
 * or after "-ch-", "-sh-", "-ph-", "-th-", "-gh-"
 * H      otherwise
 *
 * J ----> J
 *
 * K ---->        SILENT if after "c"
 * K      otherwise
 *
 * L ----> L
 *
 * M ----> M
 *
 * N ----> N
 *
 * P ----> F      if before "h"
 * P      otherwise
 *
 * Q ----> K
 *
 * R ----> R
 *
 * S ----> X      (sh) if before "h" or in "-sio-" or "-sia-"
 * S      otherwise
 *
 * T ----> X      (sh) if "-tia-" or "-tio-"
 * 0      (th) if before "h"
 * silent if in "-tch-"
 * T      otherwise
 *
 * V ----> F
 *
 * W ---->        SILENT if not followed by a vowel
 * W      if followed by a vowel
 *
 * X ----> KS
 *
 * Y ---->        SILENT if not followed by a vowel
 * Y      if followed by a vowel
 *
 * Z ----> S
 *
 * *************************************************************
 *
 * NOTE: This list turned out to be various issues that I passed over
 * while trying to discern this algorithm. The final outcome
 * of these items may or may not be reflected in the code.
 *
 * There where some discrepancies between the Pick BASIC code in the
 * original article and the verbal discription of the transformations:
 *
 * 1. CASE SYMB = "G"
 *
 * AND ENAME[N +3] = "D" AND (N + 3) = L)) and ENAM
 * ^
 * this was cut off in the magazine listing   |
 *
 * I used the verbal discription in the transformation list
 * to add the appropriate code.
 *
 * 2.  H ---->        SILENT if after vowel and no vowel follows
 * H      otherwise
 *
 * This is the transformation description, however, the BASIC
 * routine HAS code do this:
 *
 * SILENT if after "ch-", "sh-", "ph-", "th", "gh"
 *
 * which is the correct behaviour if you look at c,s,p,t,g
 *
 * If did not, however, have "after vowel" coded even though this
 * was in the description. I added it.
 *
 * 3.   The BASIC code appears to skip double letters except "C" yet
 * the transformation code for "G" looks at previous letter to
 * see if we have "GG". This is inconsistent.
 *
 * I am making the assumption that "C" was a typo in the BASIC
 * code. It should have been "G".
 *
 * 4.  Transformation notation. "-..-" where .. are letters; means that
 * the letters indicated are bounded by other letters. So "-gned"
 * means at the end and "ch-" means at the beginning. I have noticed
 * that the later is not explicity stated in the verbal description
 * but it is coded in the BASIC.
 *
 * 5.  case 'C'    K otherwise, including in "-sch-"
 * this implies that "sch" be bounded by other letters. The BASIC
 * code, however, has: N > 1
 * It should have N > 2 for this to be correct.
 * SCH-
 * 123    greater than 1 means that C can be 2nd letter
 *
 * I coded it as per the verbal description and not what was in
 * the code.
 *
 * 6.  as of 11-20-95 I am still trying to understand "H". The BASIC
 * code seems to indicate that if "-.h" is at the end it is not
 * silent. But if it is at the end there is no way a vowel could
 * follow the "h". I am looking for examples.
 *
 * 7. ok now I am really confused. Case "T". There is code in BASIC
 * that says if next = "H" and previous != "T" . There is no
 * way that a double T goes through the code. Double letters
 * are dumped in the beginning.
 *
 * MATTHEW, MATTHIES, etc
 *
 * The first T goes through the second is skipped so the
 * "th" is never detected.
 *
 * Modified routine to allow "G,T" duplicates through the switch.
 *
 * 8. case "D"  -dge- is indicated in transformation
 * -dge- or -dge is coded.
 *
 * STEMBRIDGE should have "j" on end and not "t"
 *
 * I am leaving the code as is, verbal must be wrong.
 *
 * 9. Regarding duplicate letters. "C" must be allowed through
 * as in all of the McC... names.
 *
 * The way to handle "GG and "TT" I think is to pass over the
 * first duplicate. The transformation rules would then handle
 * duplicates of themselves by looking at the PREVIOUS letter.
 *
 * This solves the problems of "TTH" where you want the "th"
 * sound.
 *
 * 10. Change "CC" so that the metaphone character is "C", they
 * way it is now for McComb and such you get "MKK", which
 * unnecessiarly eats up and extra metaphone character.
 *
 * 11. "TH" at the beginning as in Thomas. The verbal was not
 * clear about this. I think is should be "T" and not "0"
 * so I am changing code.
 *
 * After the first test I think that "THvowel" should be
 * "0" and "TH(!vowel)" should be "T"
 *
 * 12. I think throwing away 1 "S" and the end would be good.
 * Since I am doing this anyway after the fact. If I
 * do it before then names like. ..
 * BURROUGHS & BURROUGH would be the same
 * because the GH would map to the same value in
 * both cases.
 *
 * 13. Case "Y", Brian and Bryan give different codes
 * Don't know how to handle this yet.
 *
 * 14. Comments on metaphone groups. Metaphone actually
 * makes groups bigger. Names like:
 *
 * C...R...  G...R...  K...R...  Q...R...
 *
 * will map to "KR". Soundex would have produced for example
 *
 * C600,C620,G600,G620,K600,K620,Q600,Q620
 *
 * the names from these 8 groups would have been collapsed into 1.
 *
 * Another way to look at this is for a more exact initial
 * guess of a name Soundex would give you a smaller list of
 * posibilities. If you don't know how to spell it at all
 * however, your success at finding the right match with
 * Metaphone is much greater than with Soundex.
 *
 * 15. After some tests decided to leave S's at the end of the
 * Metaphone. #12 takes care of my problems with plurals and
 * then S gets used to help make distinct metaphone.
 *
 * Lawrence Philips is no longer at the company indicated in the
 * article. So I was unable to verify these items.
