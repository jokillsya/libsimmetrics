This is a C port of the Simmetrics project.

SimMetrics is a Similarity Metric Library, e.g. from edit distance's (Levenshtein, Gotoh, Jaro etc) to other metrics, (e.g Soundex, QGrams).

The code was ported from https://github.com/Simmetrics/simmetrics

This project however has advanced beyond the scope of the original Java project and can be considered the better API.

If you have trouble compiling the code the usual way, just run ./bootstrap.sh --> it should sort you out...

Most of the functions return floating points and can be customized.
